/* An implementation would typically use a separate thread or asynchronous I/O to fetch ahead data for each file.  The system will typically fill two buffers of size M for each file.  One buffer is being read out of using dbuf_read(), and the other buffer is either empty (waiting on the asynchronous I/O to start), being filled in by the asynchronous I/O mechanism, or is waiting for the caller to read data from it. */
