Fractal Tree Index Library

The Fractal Tree Index software is provided as a shared library called
"libtokufractaltreeindex-RELEASE.so".

Installation

Copy "libtokufractaltreeindex-RELEASE.so" to some place that the library 
loader uses to find libraries.

For example, on Centos 5, 64 bit libraries are found in /usr/lib64. Installation
is as simple as executing the following:
    sudo cp libtokufractaltreeindex-RELEASE.so /usr/lib64
          
Some users put it into "/usr/mysql/lib" because some useful binaries 
that employ the library include "/usr/mysql/lib" in their rpath.
          
Some users put it into /opt, for example in "/opt/tokutek/lib". In this 
case you will need to arrange for the loader to be able to find it 
(e.g., by arranging that LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /opt/tokutek/lib).

If you do not have root access you can put it into a directory in your home directory.  You may need to help the loader find it, using something like:
   mkdir ~/lib
   cp libtokufractaltreeindex-2.1.0-15000.so ~/lib/
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/lib/

Examples

To use the Fractal Tree index as an embedded database, please read the
README.examples file in the examples directory.
